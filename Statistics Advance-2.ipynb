    " <h3>Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Probability Mass Function (PMF)</h4>\n",
    "    <p>The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. The PMF is applicable only to discrete random variables.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Formally, for a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the PMF \\(P(X = x)\\) is defined as:</p>\n",
    "    <pre>P(X = x) = P(X \\text{ takes the value } x)</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    " <h3>Example</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Consider a fair six-sided die. Let \\(X\\) be the random variable representing the outcome of a single roll. The PMF of \\(X\\) is:</p>\n",
    "    <pre>\n",
    "    P(X = x) = \n",

    "    \\frac{1}{6} & \\text{if } x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\\\\n",
    "    0 & \\text{otherwise} \n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "    </pre>\n",
    "    <p>This means that the probability of rolling any one of the six faces is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), and the probability of rolling any other value is 0.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    " <h4>Probability Density Function (PDF)</h4>\n",
    "    <p>The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. Unlike the PMF, the value of the PDF at a specific point is not the probability itself but rather a value that, when integrated over an interval, gives the probability that the random variable falls within that interval.</p>\n",
    "    <p>For a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the PDF \\(f_X(x)\\) is defined such that the probability that \\(X\\) falls within the interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by:</p>\n",
    "    <pre>P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f_X(x) \\, dx</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Example</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Consider the standard normal distribution with the PDF:</p>\n",
    "    <pre>f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}</pre>\n",
    "    <p>This function describes the likelihood of a standard normal random variable (with mean 0 and variance 1) taking on a particular value.</p>\n",
    "    <p>For example, the probability that \\(X\\) falls between -1 and 1 is:</p>\n",
    "    <pre>P(-1 \\leq X \\leq 1) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} \\, dx</pre>\n",
    "    <p>This integral can be evaluated using numerical methods to find the probability.</p>\n",

    "<p><b>Answer:</b></p>\n",
    "   <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Height of People:</strong> The heights of adult men and women are often modeled using a normal distribution. When collected in large samples, they tend to form a bell-shaped curve centered around an average height.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>IQ Scores:</strong> Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores are designed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This ensures that most people score around the average, with fewer individuals achieving very high or very low scores.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Measurement Errors:</strong> In various scientific experiments and engineering processes, the errors or deviations from true measurements often follow a normal distribution because the errors tend to accumulate from many small, independent sources.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Stock Market Returns:</strong> Daily stock returns for a given stock or index are often assumed to be normally distributed. Although this is a simplification, it serves as a useful approximation for many purposes.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> The distribution of systolic blood pressure readings in a large population can be modeled using a normal distribution, with most readings clustering around the mean and fewer readings appearing at the extreme high and low ends.</li>\n",

    " <h3>Parameters of the Normal Distribution</h3>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Mean (\\(\\mu\\)):</strong> The mean is the central value around which the data is distributed. It determines the location of the peak of the bell curve. A higher mean shifts the entire distribution to the right, while a lower mean shifts it to the left.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)):</strong> The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution. It determines the width of the bell curve. A larger standard deviation results in a wider and flatter curve, indicating that the data points are spread out over a larger range of values. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller curve, indicating that the data points are closely clustered around the mean.</li>\n",

    " <h4>Assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem</h4>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The observations or data points should be independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one observation does not affect the occurrence of another.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Sample Size:</strong> The sample size should be sufficiently large. There is no strict rule on the minimum sample size, but a larger sample size tends to yield better approximations.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Identical Distribution:</strong> The observations should come from the same probability distribution. This distribution can be any distribution, not necessarily normal, but the CLT tells us the distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as the sample size increases.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Finite Variance:</strong> The population should have a finite variance. This assumption ensures that the mean of the sample means converges to the population mean as the sample size increases.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n"
